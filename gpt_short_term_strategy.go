GPT Response:
Sure, here's an example of a short-term trading strategy that uses Moving Averages to make buy and sell decisions:

{... CODE ...}

This strategy makes use of two moving averages with different time frames, 20 and 50 candles, to determine the trend of the market.
If the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it signals a buy opportunity.
If the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it signals a sell opportunity.

func GPTShortTermStrategy(candles Candles) (Signal, float64) {
	numberOfCandles := len(candles)

	// Calculate the simple moving average for the last 20 candles
	var shortSMA float64
	for i := numberOfCandles - 20; i < numberOfCandles; i++ {
		shortSMA += candles[i].Close.Bid
	}
	shortSMA /= 20

	// Calculate the simple moving average for the last 50 candles
	var longSMA float64
	for i := numberOfCandles - 50; i < numberOfCandles; i++ {
		longSMA += candles[i].Close.Bid
	}
	longSMA /= 50

	price := candles[numberOfCandles-1].Close.Bid

	// Buy signal: short-term SMA crosses above long-term SMA
	if shortSMA > longSMA && shortSMA > price {
		return BUY, price
	}

	// Sell signal: short-term SMA crosses below long-term SMA
	if shortSMA < longSMA && shortSMA < price {
		return SELL, price
	}

	return NONE, price
}
