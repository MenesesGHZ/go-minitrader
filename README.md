This bot is a forex trading solution that uses strategies generated by GPT3 to trade the markets. It currently utilizes Capital.com as its main broker.
The bot is built with Golang, utilizing a concurrent implementation to maximize efficiency. 


### Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"

	gominitrader "github.com/menesesghz/go-minitrader"
)

func main() {
	capitalClient, err := gominitrader.NewCapitalClient("your@email.com", "<API_TOKEN>", "<API_TOKEN_PASSWORD>", true)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Trade the USD/JPY currency pair with a 2% stop loss and a 0.35% upperbound profit target using 15-minute intervals and the GPTStrategy.
	minitraderUSDJPY := gominitrader.NewMinitrader(
		"USDJPY", 25, 2, 0.35, gominitrader.MINUTE_15, gominitrader.GPTStrategy,
	)

	// Trade the USD/CAD currency pair with a 2% stop loss and a 0.35% upperbound profit target using 15-minute intervals and the GPTStrategy.
	minitraderUSDCAD := gominitrader.NewMinitrader(
		"USDCAD", 25, 2, 0.35, gominitrader.MINUTE_15, gominitrader.GPTShortTermStrategy,
	)

	// Trade the USD/MXN currency pair with a 2% stop loss and a 0.35% upperbound profit target using 15-minute intervals and the GPTShortTermStrategy.
	minitraderUSDMXN := gominitrader.NewMinitrader(
		"USDMXN", 50, 2, 0.35, gominitrader.MINUTE_15, gominitrader.GPTShortTermStrategy,
	)

	minitraderPool, _ := gominitrader.NewMinitraderPool(capitalClient, minitraderUSDJPY, minitraderUSDCAD, minitraderUSDMXN)
	minitraderPool.Start()
}
```
The previous code is a main Go program that trades forex using the go-minitrader package. It establishes a new client connection to Capital.com, which serves as the designated broker for the bot's trades.

Then, it sets up three different instances of the minitrader for the currency pairs `USD/JPY`, `USD/CAD`, and `USD/MXN` with the same stop loss (2%) and upperbound profit target (0.35%), but with different trade sizes 
(25 for `USD/JPY`, 50 for `USD/MXN`, and default of 25 for `USD/CAD`) and different strategies (`GPTStrategy` for `USD/JPY`, `GPTShortTermStrategy` for `USD/CAD` and `USD/MXN`).

Finally, the program creates a new pool of minitraders, adds the three instances to it and starts the trading process by calling the `Start()` method.

### Features To Be Implemented
1. Backtesting Engine: The aim of this feature is to develop a backtesting engine that would allow 
testing the performance of the trading strategies before applying them on real trades.
 
2. Telegram Bot Integration: This feature aims to integrate the trading bot with the Telegram 
Bot API to allow for easy monitoring and control of trades.
 
3. Pull Historical Data from Trading View: To improve the performance of the trading strategies, 
it is necessary to access a larger data set. This feature aims to pull historical data from Trading View, 
which has a higher data limit compared to Capital.com API's limit of 10 requests per second.


### Note

It is important to underline that this is a alpha version, all the strategies haven't been backtested. Only trade with funds that you can afford to lose. This bot is provided as-is and no guarantees 
or warranties are made regarding its performance. Use at your own risk.
